	draw flag

	init()
		reset registers
		set PC to 0x200(512) // Start of most Chip8 programs
		load fonts into memory from 0 to 80
		setup SDL. Create window, renderer etc.
		load rom and start emulation
	cycle()
		get opcode from opcode located at PC
		Process opcode
		increment PC by 2 bytes. Each opcode is 2bytes
		decrement timers if necessary
		play sound if timer==0
